How do you know if your training intervention is having a positive effect on the well being of your team at work?

1. Before you implement your intervention (training) ask your team to complete the online questionnaire in order to get a base-line measurement of their well being.
1. Implement your training intervention. Get all the team to engage with training over a number of days or weeks.
3. At the end of your training program ask you whole team to complete the online questionnaire again in order to measure whether there has been any change in the well being of the team.

## What is SWEMWEBS?
## How does it work?
## How does the maths work?
Basically the before and after results are analysed to see whether the there is a change 
## How does the app collect and process your data?
The beauty of this system is that the data is collected and analysed automagically online.
## Concerns
Please note that any change in the well being of the team may not be solely or partially caused the intervention. If we assume that the intervention is the only thing to have changed we may assume that our system is measuring that change. To true study the effect of the intervention we should carry out a double blind trial with a control group.
