Hi-2-all

Please don't use the buttons above - all formating should be done using markdown symbols within the text (see below).

Use this etherpad space to create a markdown document (this is a live space, we can all work on this document together at the same time - now that is cool)

<Now try adding your own markdown text below>





# What is Markdown

use the # symbol at the beginning of the line to create a header

# This is a header in markdown

## This is a second level header in markdown

- list something
- list something else
- something else

1. list item 1
2. list item 2
3. list item 3

In markdown the link above should be written as ...

[<link text>](<web address>)

[markdown link](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet)

If you look at the link above you will find other ways in which to use markdown.

Markdown will enable you to let go of your word processor and use a simple text editor to create all your documents.

Spend a little time learning markdown and you will never look back. It will enable you to concentrate on the text and not the formating.
